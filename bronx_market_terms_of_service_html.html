      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Bronx Market</strong> ("we," "our," "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and purchase of digital assets, accounts, and other virtual goods ("Products") offered by Bronx Market. By completing a purchase, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not proceed with your purchase.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Nature of Products</h2>
      <p>All Bronx Market products are <strong>digital goods</strong>. Delivery occurs <strong>manually via Discord</strong> after payment confirmation. By purchasing, you acknowledge that you are buying an intangible digital product that cannot be physically returned or revoked once delivered.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Delivery Policy</h2>
      <p>All orders are delivered <strong>manually via Discord</strong> to the username or server provided by the customer. Delivery is considered complete once Bronx Market provides proof of transfer or delivery confirmation (for example: a Discord message, screenshot, or other fulfillment record).</p>
      <p class="mini-note">If you fail to provide accurate contact or account information, Bronx Market is <strong>not responsible</strong> for delays, non-delivery, or forfeiture of the order.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Refund & Replacement Policy</h2>
      <p>All sales are <strong>final</strong>. Refunds are issued <strong>only</strong> if the following condition is met:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- A purchased account is <strong>banned due to alt detection</strong> within <strong>48 hours</strong> of delivery. In that case, Bronx Market may provide a replacement or refund, at our discretion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Refunds <strong>will not</strong> be provided for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Buyer’s remorse</li>
        <li>- Unauthorized or accidental purchases (contact support first)</li>
        <li>- Account misuse or bans not related to alt detection</li>
        <li>- Failure to use the item correctly or follow provided instructions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All refund requests must be submitted through official Bronx Market support channels (our Discord server).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. No Chargeback Policy</h2>
      <p>By purchasing from Bronx Market, you agree <strong>not to initiate any chargeback or payment dispute</strong> for any fulfilled order. All disputes should be handled internally through our support team first.</p>
      <p class="mini-note">Any chargeback filed after confirmed delivery is a breach of these Terms. Bronx Market reserves the right to submit proof of delivery and your agreement to these Terms to Stripe or other payment processors in response to disputes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Proof of Delivery</h2>
      <p>We maintain records of transaction details and delivery confirmations, including Discord logs, timestamps, screenshots, and other relevant data. These records may be used as evidence in the event of any payment dispute or chargeback.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>7. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for providing correct and active contact details (Discord username and any necessary tags). Bronx Market is not liable for delivery failures resulting from incorrect Discord tags, account inaccessibility, or inactivity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>8. Support & Contact</h2>
      <p>For support, refund eligibility review, or other inquiries, contact our official Bronx Market Discord Server or the contact information provided at checkout. Always submit disputes to us first so we can help resolve them quickly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>9. Agreement</h2>
      <p>By purchasing, you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- You have read and understood these Terms.</li>
        <li>- You agree that all sales are final except as stated above.</li>
        <li>- You agree not to initiate chargebacks for fulfilled orders covered by these Terms.</li>
